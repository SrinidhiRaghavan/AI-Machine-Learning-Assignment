COMPARISON OF CONVERGENCE RATES - 
When alpha is either too small or too large, the value of beta keeps fluctuating and hence, number of iterations is more
The correct value of alpha must update beta such that the next beta is not too large than the first but also not too close to it to differentiate it from the next
I chose the value of 0.9 for alpha as it has the least number of iterations as 13
